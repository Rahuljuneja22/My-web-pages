        Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. 
        Once contaminated, hands can transfer 
        the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. 
        From there, the virus can enter your body 
        and can make you sick.

        Make sure you, and the people around you, 
        follow good respiratory hygiene. This means 
        covering your mouth and nose with your 
        bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. 
        Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
